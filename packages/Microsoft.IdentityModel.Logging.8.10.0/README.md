[![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Microsoft.IdentityModel.JsonWebTokens?label=Latest%20release)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.IdentityModel.JsonWebTokens/)

The **IdentityModel Extensions for .NET** library provides robust tools to enhance authentication and authorization workflows in your .NET applications. Backed by the Entra team, this library simplifies working with OpenID Connect (OIDC), OAuth2.0, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) in .NET.

Whether you're building secure APIs, implementing token validation, or managing claims, this library is designed to handle the heavy lifting for you.

> **Why IdentityModel?**
> - **Widely Adopted:** Trusted by thousands of developers to integrate OIDC and OAuth2.0 standards.
> - **Secure by Design:** Built with security as a priority to reduce common vulnerabilities.
> - **Extensible:** Easily extend or customize for advanced use cases.
> - **Battle hardened:** Validates 5+ trillion requests daily, and growing.
